# Interaction Instructions
My interaction method is to use the keyboard to interact: use the W, A, S, and D keys to control Pac-Man to move up, down, left, and right. And make Pac-Man walk along the maze path and then "eat" all four ghosts. When all ghosts are eaten, a message "Mission Success!" will pop up.
